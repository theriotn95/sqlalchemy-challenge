Hawaiin Weather Stations Temperature Observations 


In this challenge I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. All of the analysis were completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


The analyzed data consisted of various temperature reading from different statons in the Hawaiin island chain and included temperatures observed over multiple years inlcuding the precipitatons(prcp) levels. 


After the completion of the initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I have just developed.
